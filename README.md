# Roll20 Design System Study

## About

This is a project for the Web Development course at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) as part of the Masters of Graphic and Web Design (MAGWD) Program.

In this project, I dissected the account homepage for the popular Virtual Table Top (VTT) Website, [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), then developed a simple component library from the study. After completing the component library, I took each of the coded components and layered them to build an approximate recreation of the original page.
